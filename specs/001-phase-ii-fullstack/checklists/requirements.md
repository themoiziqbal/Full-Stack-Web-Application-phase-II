# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase II – Full-Stack Web Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-31
**Feature**: [specs/001-phase-ii-fullstack/spec.md](D:\Saba_Umar_Abbasi\mywork(c)\Homework_Giaic\q4\evolution-of-todo-app\specs\001-phase-ii-fullstack\spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) in the Requirements/Scenarios
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification derived from Phase II goals.
- Implementation details (FastAPI, Next.js, Better Auth) were moved to the "Assumptions" and "Technology Matrix" in the Constitution to keep the spec clean.
